## üì∏ Example Walkthrough ‚Äî Real Terminal Session

![DarkelfAi Terminal Screenshot](DarkelfAi.png)

**What happened in this session:**

1. User asked:
   ```
   Ask a question: what is 2+2
   ```

2. Darkelf responded:
   > 4 is the answer to 2+2. However, as I'm an OSINT and cyber assistant, let me provide some recommendations...

   And listed steps like:
   - Analyzing emails
   - Tracing IPs
   - Cross-referencing hashes
   - Suggesting better security practices

3. User typed `osintscan JohnDoe` ‚Äî which produced an ‚ùå Unknown command

4. Then corrected to just `osintscan` ‚Äî which worked and prompted for a term.
