## 🗄️ Secure Vault

Darkelf includes a memory-safe **Secure Vault** system that:
- 💾 Stores session logs, email/phone recon data, and Onion scans
- 🔐 Uses AES-GCM with optional hybrid PQ key-wrapping (`ML-KEM-768`)
- 🧼 Supports zeroization on exit or `panic` command
- 🔍 Vault entries can be listed, exported, or searched inside the REPL
- 🛡️ Optionally syncs across encrypted temp volumes if used in air-gapped systems

Use the REPL to manage your Vault:

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Dependencies

Install Tor & Python 3.11:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install tor python3.11

# macOS (using brew)
brew install tor python@3.11
```

### 2. Python Modules

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
python3.11 Darkelf_CLI_TL_Edition_Patched_FINAL_FIXED_WORKING.py
```

Use the REPL prompt for commands like:

- `search <query>` — DuckDuckGo .onion search
- `osintscan <phone|username>` — OSINT scan on target
- `message send` — Start encrypted messaging
- `vault show/export/clear` — Manage secure Vault entries
- `wipe` — Trigger panic mode
- `launch <tool>` — Run an integrated OSINT utility
- `beacon <onion>` — Check onion site status
- `exit` — Quit securely

---

## ✅ Supported Platforms

- ✅ macOS (Apple Silicon M1–M4)
- ✅ Linux (Debian, Arch, Fedora)
- ✅ Windows (WSL2 Recommended)
- ✅ Android (via Termux)

---

## 🔐 Security Model

- Encrypted logs are stored only in memory (`AES-GCM`) and purged on exit.
- All metadata stays local; no 3rd-party OSINT APIs like Numverify or PhoneInfoga are used.
- All search is routed through `DuckDuckGo Onion Lite` to bypass tracking & geofiltering.
- Carrier and location data is inferred offline using `phonenumbers`, `geocoder`, and `timezone`.
